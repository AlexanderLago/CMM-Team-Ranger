# CoverMyMeds Project

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks exploring simulated pharmaceutical data(not included) provided by CoverMyMeds. The data includes date, pharmacy, diagnosis, drug, and three indicators of insurance. We are also provided whether or not the insurance rejected covering the drug, and if the insurance did accept the drug, how much the patient paid in copay. These last two features are the features we want to predict. 

We also have secondary goals. We would also like to provide a list of alternative drugs that are more likely to be covered by insurance, cheaper, or both.

In the EDA folder, we have several notebooks understanding the relationship of the features to the target.

In the models folder, we explored different models to predict the target.

In the Formulary Status folder, we explored how to find alternative drugs.
