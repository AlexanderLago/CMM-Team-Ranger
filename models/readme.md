# Model Notebooks

The model notebooks are located here. We have

- Linear Regression
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

We attempted Random Forests, but it is too slow. We also attempted neural networks, but the results are not as good as gradient boosting, and we decided it is not worth continuing to improve a neural network model.
